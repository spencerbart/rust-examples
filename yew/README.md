# Yew

Yew is a framework for building websites. It is very similar to React.

You need to install trunk

```Bash
# note that this might take a while to install, because it compiles everything from scratch
# Trunk also provides prebuilt binaries for a number of major package managers
# See https://trunkrs.dev/#install for further details
cargo install trunk
```

Then run

```Bash
trunk server --open
```
